# SqueezeNet
SqueezeNet is a small CNN which achieves AlexNet level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. SqueezeNet requires less communication across servers during distributed training, less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car and more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory.

## Model
Squeezenet 1.0 gives AlexNet level of accuracy with 50X fewer parameters.
SqueezeNet 1.1 has 2.4x less computation and slightly fewer parameters than SqueezeNet 1.0, without sacrificing accuracy.

## Inference
We used MXNet as framework with gluon APIs to perform inference. View the notebook [imagenet_inference](../imagenet_inference.ipynb) to understand how to use above models for doing inference. Make sure to specify the appropriate model name in the notebook.

### Input 
All pre-trained models expect input images normalized in the same way, i.e. mini-batches of 3-channel RGB images of shape (N x 3 x H x W), where N is the batch size, and H and W are expected to be at least 224. The inference was done using a jpeg image.

### Preprocessing
The images have to be loaded in to a range of [0, 1] and then normalized using mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. The transformation should preferrably happen at preprocessing.

```bash
def preprocess(img):   
    '''
    Preprocessing required on the images for inference with mxnet gluon
    The function takes path to an image and returns processed tensor
    '''
    transform_fn = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(224),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ])
    img = transform_fn(img)
    img = img.expand_dims(axis=0) # batchify
    
    return img
    
 ```
 

### Output
The model outputs image scores for each of the [1000 classes of ImageNet](../synset.txt).

### Postprocessing
The post-processing involves calculating the softmax probablility scores for each classes and sorting them to report the most probable classes.

```bash
def postprocess(scores): 
    '''
    Postprocessing with mxnet gluon
    The function takes scores generated by network and returns the class ids in decreasing order
    of probability
    '''
    prob = mx.ndarray.softmax(scores).asnumpy()
    # print the top-5 inferences class
    prob = np.squeeze(prob)
    a = np.argsort(prob)[::-1]
    return a
    
 ```

### Inference with Model Server
Head on to [Quick start section of model server](https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/master/README.md#quick-start) for serving your models. 
* **Start Server**:
```bash
mxnet-model-server --models squeezenet1_1=https://s3.amazonaws.com/onnx-model-zoo/squeezentnet/squeezenet1.1/squeezenet1.1.model
```

* **Run Prediction**:
```bash
curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/model-server/inputs/kitten.jpg
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/squeezenet1_1/predict -F "data=@kitten.jpeg"
```
Use the dataname as 'data' in predict call for all the above SqueezeNet models
## Dataset
Dataset used for train and validation: [ILSVRC2012](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/). Check [imagenet_prep](../imagenet_prep.md) for guidelines on preparing the dataset.

## Validation accuracy
The accuracies obtained by the models on the validation set as mentioned above. The accuracies has been calculate on center cropped 
images and is similar to accuracy obtained in the paper.
